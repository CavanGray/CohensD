# CohensD
A more useful CohensD function 

I didn't like how most of the packages computed Cohens D, they required a lot of data manipulation for a really simple statistic. 
This allows minimal manipulation, scalable to numerous categories and values, allows use of string variables and multiple score variables all consolidated into a single output matrix
